# Linear Regression
House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Machine Learning model to predict house price using linear regression only.

For this problem we will be using Boston Housing Data, each row describes a boston town or suburb. There are 506 rows and 13 attributes (features) with a target column (price). https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.names


Here our data has a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price. To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learnâ€™s boston dataset.
